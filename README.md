PROBLEM STATEMENT :
            Navigating around places has always been a difficult task for visually impaired people. It has always made them to be dependent on someone.

YOLO version 3:
YOLO is an abbreviation for the term ‘You Only Look Once’. This is an algorithm that detects and recognizes various objects in a picture (in real-time). Object detection in YOLO is done as a regression problem and provides the class probabilities of the detected images.

REASON FOR YOLO :
Speed: This algorithm improves the speed of detection because it can predict objects in real-time.
High accuracy: YOLO is a predictive technique that provides accurate results with minimal background errors.
Learning capabilities: The algorithm has excellent learning capabilities that enable it to learn the representations of objects and apply them in object detection.
